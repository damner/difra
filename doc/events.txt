Working with event handlers:

Get events object:
\Difra\Events\Event::getInstance(string $type)

Register your own event handler:
$event->registerHandler(callable $handler)

Prevent default handlers call:
$event->preventDefault();

Prevent any further handlers call, including default handlers:
$event->stopPropagation();


User defined handlers:

Register default handler (for user defined events only):
$event->registerDefaultHandler(callable $handler)

Trigger event:
$event->trigger();
